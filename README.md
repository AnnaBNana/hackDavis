# CareCost
#### Carecost, a platform where consumers explore and contribute crowd-sourced data on the actual cost of medical care.

Carecost is an application to help medical consumers compare the relative costs of procedures in their geographical area. Its purpose is to empower medical consumers and hold medical and insurance providers accountable.

This project was built in under 24 hours by a team of 4 experienced full-stack developers for Hack Davis in January of 2017.
